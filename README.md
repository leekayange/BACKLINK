Selling documents online can be done through various platforms and methods. Here's a general overview of how you can sell documents online:

1. **Create Your Documents:** First, create the documents you want to sell. These could be eBooks, guides, templates, reports, or any other type of digital document.

2. **Choose a Platform:** There are several platforms where you can sell digital documents online. Some popular options include:

   - **Your Own Website:** Create a website to sell your documents. You can use platforms like WordPress with WooCommerce, Shopify, or other e-commerce solutions to set up your online store.
   
   - **Marketplace Websites:** Sell your documents on marketplace websites such as Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (for eBooks), Etsy, eBay, or Gumroad. These platforms provide a ready-made audience and can help you reach a larger customer base.

3. **Set Up Your Store:** If you're using your own website, set up your online store by creating product pages for each document you want to sell. Include a description of the document, pricing information, and any other relevant details.

4. **Payment Processing:** Set up a payment gateway to process payments from customers. Most e-commerce platforms and marketplace websites offer built-in payment processing options, or you can use third-party services like PayPal or Stripe.

5. **Marketing and Promotion:** Once your store is set up, market and promote your documents to attract customers. You can use social media, email marketing, content marketing, and other strategies to drive traffic to your store.

6. **Fulfillment:** After a customer purchases a document, deliver the document to them electronically. Most e-commerce platforms and marketplace websites will handle this process for you automatically.

7. **Customer Support:** Provide customer support to address any questions or issues customers may have regarding their purchases. This can help build trust and encourage repeat business.

8. **Monitor and Optimize:** Monitor your sales and customer feedback to identify areas for improvement. Optimize your pricing, marketing strategies, and product offerings to maximize sales.

By following these steps, you can start selling your documents online and generate income from your digital content.
